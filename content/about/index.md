I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Sustainability and Center for Behavior, Institutions and the Environment (CBIE) at Arizona State University. I am pursuing my PhD in Sustainability.

My research focuses on the motivations for people to engage in collective action for meeting sustainability goals, and the challenges to achieving these shared objectives. I am particularly interested in looking at how evolving social and political institutions mediate collective responses to social dilemmas like natural resource management and climate change. For my PhD dissertation, I study the determinants of groundwater governance in rapidly urbanizing contexts in India, the largest user of groundwater in the world. This research is supported by the National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (NSF-DDRIG). My work draws on behavioral economics, institutional theories and human geography, and employs mixed methods to investigate the determinants of human behavior and decision making within the context of sustainability.
